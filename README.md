## About

Given a context, expands mustache templates with it

## Usage

### As a global package

```sh
pub global activate -sgit https://www.github.com/devkabiir/scaffold
```

Give it a `context.json`, path to template and output directory

```sh
scaffold --context=template.context.json --template=<path/to/template> .
```

This will expand to the current working directory

By default it takes the `context.json` from the current working directory if found,
or takes it from the `<user-directory>/<template_name>.context.json` if present, otherwise
you can specify it via the `--context` flag

If `<user-directory>/mustache.context.json` exists, it gets _merged_ with the `context.json` found in
the previous step

### As a dependency

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  scaffold:
    git: https://www.github.com/devkabiir/scaffold
```

```dart
import 'package:scaffold/scaffold.dart' as scaffold;

void main() => print();

```
